{"google":"","name":"Spotter","body":"# Spotter : Unsophisticated video tracking\r\n\r\nSpotter can track LEDs in a video stream--either from a webcam or video file--and simultaneously write encoded video to disk. It is based on the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) library. It's a very early alpha and hardly working.\r\n\r\n![Structure](https://raw.github.com/wonkoderverstaendige/Spotter/master/media/img/ScriptStructure.png)\r\n\r\n## Simple Example\r\n\r\n    python spotter.py --source video.avi\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    python spotter.py --source 0 --outfile result.avi --dims 640x360 --fps 15\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 7 64bit, (X)Ubuntu 12.04 64bit\r\n\r\n- Python 2.7+\r\n- OpenCV 2.4.3+\r\n- docopt 0.5\r\n\r\n## Future\r\nPosition information and crossing of ROIs will be sent to a microcontroller via serial port.","tagline":"Led Tracker w/ opencv and python","note":"Don't delete this file!
